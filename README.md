Syntax highighting for ACPI source language (ASL)
=================================================

This provides very simple syntax highlighting and formatting support for
ASL files as specified in ACPI 6.1.

Install
-------

Currently all you need to do is to copy the corresponding files from
directories in this repository to your `~/.vim/` directory. For example
you copy `syntax/asl.vim` to `~/.vim/syntax/asl.vim` and so on.

Usage
-----

Once the files are installed the syntax highlighting and other settings
will be automatically enabled anytime you edit a `.asl` or `.dsl` files.
